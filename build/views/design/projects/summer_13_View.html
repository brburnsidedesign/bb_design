After visiting this site at the beginning of this project, the following aims were immediately established: to maintain this sense of open air and to avoid, at all costs, contributing to the claustrophobia created by the busy road. As this project required spatial allocation for wide variety of activities and that a number of circulation paths be choreographed, pursuing these goals proved to be a fascinating challenge.</p></div><ul class="project-pics col-xs-12"><li><img class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 img-responsive" src=build/assets/img/monk_1.jpg alt=project_1></li><li><img class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 img-responsive" src=build/assets/img/monk_2.jpg alt=project_2></li><li><img class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 img-responsive" src=build/assets/img/monk_3.jpg alt=project_3></li></ul></section></div><div class=row><section class="col-xs-12 white-section" id=monk><button class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--fab mdl-js-ripple-effect up-arrow" href=# scroll-to=top offset=1000><i class="fa fa-arrow-up" aria-hidden=true></i></button><div class=design-solo-words><h5 class=design-solo-title>THE MONK +<br>THE EXHIBITIONIST</h5><h6 class=design-solo-info>Harvard University Graduate School of Design</h6><h6 class=design-solo-info>Career Discovery Summer 2013</h6><h6 class=design-solo-info>Critic: Laura Haak</h6><hr><p class=design-solo-para>The two clients for this dual-residence were a “reclusive monk” and a “prudent exhibitionist.” Though seemingly opposites and extremely unlikely neighbors, their qualities as implied through their titles played quite formally on the public and the private.

The challenge became about using this simple shape to create the possibility for this tall room to be incredibly fun and social, while also allowing for enough division for practical spaces such as a museum bookstore. The shape of the box had to contain and house, but also entice.<br><br>Inspired by an internship at Dia Art Foundation that ended shortly before the beginning of this project, the chosen programming for the Long Room was a Museum of Art, and minimalist sculpture from artists such as Dan Graham and Walter De Maria were very present in the line of thinking. Using De Maria’s work in particular as a mental precedent, led to experimenting with choreographing the space of the Tall Room, (which must be traversed to get to the Long Room) through what I called “benign obstructions” - objects that don’t necessarily obstruct but demand being walked around.<br><br>In order to encourage a fun and social atmosphere in the Tall Room, strategic slippages in the construction of the boxes were allowed to occur, through extending certain walls or sliding them out slightly. These slippages and the cuts they created were very subtle and served to simultaneously hint at the activity going on in other rooms but also deliberately choreograph the visitor’s path to and through said rooms, leading them ultimately to the staircase.</p></div><ul class="project-pics col-xs-12"><li><img class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 img-responsive" src=build/assets/img/tall_room_1.jpg alt=project_1></li><li><img class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 img-responsive" src=build/assets/img/tall_room_2.jpg alt=project_2></li><li><img class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 img-responsive" src=build/assets/img/tall_room_3.jpg alt=project_3></li></ul></section></div></div>
