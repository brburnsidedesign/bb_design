           The proposed site of this project currently houses a beautiful and rustic flower shop, which is a welcome respite in an area surrounded by loud traffic and congestion. After visiting this site at the beginning of this project, the following aims were immediately established: to maintain this sense of open air and to avoid, at all costs, contributing to the claustrophobia created by the busy road. As this project required spatial allocation for wide variety of activities and that a number of circulation paths be choreographed, pursuing these goals proved to be a fascinating challenge.

               The two clients for this dual-residence were a “reclusive monk” and a “prudent exhibitionist.” Though seemingly opposites and extremely unlikely neighbors, their qualities as implied through their titles played quite formally on the public and the private. Again, strategically utilizing openings and enclosures in the development of this space left room for the possibility of brief interaction between the two clients, while also facilitating opportunities for the acts of seeing and being seen.

		         This project initiated the exploration of the spatial dynamics and functional potential of the shape of the box. The challenge became about using this simple shape to create the possibility for this tall room to be incredibly fun and social, while also allowing for enough division for practical spaces such as a museum bookstore. The shape of the box had to contain and house, but also entice.
		         <br>
		         <br>
		         Inspired by an internship at Dia Art Foundation that ended shortly before the beginning of this project, the chosen programming for the Long Room was a Museum of Art, and minimalist sculpture from artists such as Dan Graham and Walter De Maria were very present in the line of thinking. Using De Maria’s work in particular as a mental precedent, led to experimenting with choreographing the space of the Tall Room, (which must be traversed to get to the Long Room) through what I called “benign obstructions” - objects that don’t necessarily obstruct but demand being walked around.
		         <br>
		         <br>
		         In order to encourage a fun and social atmosphere in the Tall Room, strategic slippages in the construction of the boxes were allowed to occur, through extending certain walls or sliding them out slightly. These slippages and the cuts they created were very subtle and served to simultaneously hint at the activity going on in other rooms but also deliberately choreograph the visitor’s path to and through said rooms, leading them ultimately to the staircase.
